            China controls the world’s rare earths – the metals that drive green technologies. But the true cost is paid far from the spotlight, in poisoned valleys and guarded cities. A journey to Baotou, where the global clean-energy boom begins in toxic silence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="byline">
            <p>By Lea Löwenzahn</p>
        </div>
        <p>The trail begins far in the north. In Inner Mongolia, an autonomous region of China, three times the size of Germany. The people here are broader-shouldered than in the south, rougher, with cheeks reddened by the sun of the high plains. A land from which the Mongols once set out to conquer the world. Today, it belongs to the People’s Republic, ruled by a party with just as great an appetite for power – perhaps even greater. It takes three hours by high-speed train from Beijing to reach Baotou. A city of 2.7 million, one of the most important industrial centers in the region. Cranes, construction sites, new roads. Smokestacks shape the skyline. Here, the economy is still growing.

</div>

     </div>
        <p>From there, the road leads north to the mining district, three hours outside the city. A new four-lane highway cuts through empty plains, past hills, wild horses and tourist-ready yurts. Then a sign appears: Bayan Obo. Just 50 kilometers south of the Mongolian border, it marks the epicenter of China’s rare earth dominance. In the surrounding mountains lies nearly half the world’s known reserves. The mine gives Beijing a leverage no other power possesses.

But beyond the sign, the road stops. Police wave down every car at a toll station. When the reporters arrive, it’s clear what they’re looking for: “Foreigners,” an officer says. Passports are taken, the car searched. More vehicles arrive, nearly ten officers in total. The driver is questioned, then the reporters. The official reason for denying access: flooding. The sky is blue. No clouds, no puddles. After a long wait, they’re told to turn back. They’re allowed to drive on – but not to the mine. No reason given. From then on, they’re followed. One car, then two, then three. When the mine finally comes into view, it’s just a dark line along the ridge. Excavators crawl along its spine.

       <p>What becomes visible here is the largest rare earth deposit in the world. Three open pits stretch across nearly 50 square kilometers. From east to west, the site spans about 18 kilometers, with some pits plunging as deep as 1,000 meters. Around 6,000 workers are employed here. In the ground: neodymium, lanthanum, yttrium – and thorium, a mildly radioactive metal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step step-1" id="step2">
      <p>Nowhere is the impact more visible than in the south of Baotou. There lies a lake you won’t find in any tourist brochure. Grey, motionless, twelve square kilometers wide – as large as a city district. At its edge: pipelines, steaming smokestacks, metal processing plants. For decades, companies have dumped their waste here: heavy-metal sludge, concentrated rare earths, acids, radioactive residues. Millions of tons each year. The reservoir was built without sealing. Since the 1960s, toxic substances have been seeping into the soil and groundwater. The Yellow River – lifeline for hundreds of millions – flows just ten kilometers away.

Tests show rare earth concentrations in the groundwater up to ten times higher than normal. Air samples also reveal fine particles, carried by wind across hundreds of kilometers. Children are especially vulnerable. In their blood, urine and hair, rare earth levels often exceed international safety limits. These metals can cause cancer, growth disorders, and bone deformities. No birds fly here anymore. The settlement at the dam’s edge was evacuated years ago, the houses left behind. Yet just one street over, people still sit in restaurants, children still play. Nearly three million people live in Baotou. Many have no idea what lies beyond the dam. And yet, this place is what makes the green transition possible – cheaper than anywhere else, except for those who live here.</p>

        <p>If all goes according to schedule, bullet trains will cross the river here by late 2026. For the residents it will mark the beginning of a different rhythm. And perhaps, for a moment, the Yellow River will seem just a little less wide.</p>
