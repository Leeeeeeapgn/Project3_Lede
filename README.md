#Short description of what I tried to accomplish

Another project that started with failure. I originally wanted to scrape a Chinese website using an undocumented API — spent two days on it, didn’t work out. 
It turned out to be harder than expected. So I shifted focus. I had recently been to a region known for rare earth mining in China and decided to 
combine that reporting trip with some data research. Since on-the-ground access is limited and often blocked by security forces, 
satellite images seemed like a good workaround.

#Short description of your findings/ Overview of the data analysis process
I used Copernicus Sentinel data from the EU to look at two mining areas. I also tried to compare images over time, 
but the archive for that region only goes back to the early 2010s. Nasa had more data but with a too small frame.

To give some spatial context, I made a map using geojson.io and visualized it in Datawrapper. I also used Figma for some design work.

In terms of design I used the template for scrolly-stories. I copied it from my last project but made some chances because last time the format didn't seem to work. Some pics where 
too small, others too big. By trying to fix it I broke it comepletely once.. but fixed it again. 

#A section about things you tried to do or wanted to do but did not have the skills/time (but if you have more time you might do)

- Looked for signs of local impact by scraping Chinese social media
- Asked a commercial satellite provider for high-resolution imagery
- Smoothed out the HTML and mobile layout a bit more
